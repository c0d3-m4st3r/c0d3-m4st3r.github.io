## [](#header-2)Who I am?

Hello! I'm **Francisco Ramos Vega**, also known as **c0d3-m4ster**. 

I am a software engineer graduated from the University of Jaen. I am specialized in **SysAdmin** and I'm trying to **learn everyday** about this world.

## [](#header-2)What will I post on this blog?

I'll try to post about all the new technologies I'm learning. I will also provide tutorials that, apart from serving you, will help me to strengthen concepts.

Thanks for the visit. I hope you have learned a lot.
